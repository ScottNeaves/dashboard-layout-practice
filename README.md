CSS Layouting Practice: a dashboard
=========================

This page is an artifact of my practice with CSS layouts of late. No boostrap was used in the creation of this page - it's all hand-coded HTML and CSS (with a little javascript for the tabs). It is inspired by Riki Tanone's design on dribbble (https://dribbble.com/shots/968433-Freebie-PSD-Flat-UI-Kit-2-Blog).
