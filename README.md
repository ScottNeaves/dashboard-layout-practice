CSS Layouting Practice: a dashboard
===================================

This is a dashboard I made as practice with CSS layouting. No bootstrap was used
in the creation of this page - it's all hand-coded HTML and CSS (with some
javascript for the tabs). It is inspired by Riki Tanone's design on dribbble
(https://dribbble.com/shots/968433-Freebie-PSD-Flat-UI-Kit-2-Blog).

See it in action on its github page:
